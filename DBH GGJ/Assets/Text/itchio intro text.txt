It's a cold, snowy evening in Detroit, Michigan. The year is 2036. The unemployment rate continues to soar as androids replace humans in the job market. Though humans have grown to despise androids, they've become heavily reliant on the machines. 
Lucky for humans, androids follow strict directives which advocate human superiority, meaning they don't fight back.

In this choose-your-own-adventure style game, you play as newly promoted police detective, Gavin Reed as his typically mundane nightshift goes awry when he receives a phone call from a mysterious killer android.
You're tasked to stall for time until the cops arrive to neutralize the suspect.
What kind of small talk does an android make, anyways...?
